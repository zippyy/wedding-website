The most important thing to us is that you are able to celebrate with us on our wedding day. However, if you wish to give a gift, we will gratefully accept. Please see the Registry links below.

        <p>Your coming to our wedding is a gift</p>
        <p>Greater than rubies, or some shop-bought thing.</p>
        <p>Which brings us onto ‘presents’: tricky stuff.</p>
        <p>We won’t send out a Harrods’ Wedding List</p>
        <p>But if you had a little cash to spare,</p>
        <p>That’s what we’d like please, to help make our home.</p>
        <p>Whatever comes our way will touch our hearts,</p>
        <p>And seeing your dear faces when we say our vows.</p>
