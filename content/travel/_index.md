Fly into New orleans International (MSY)

<br>

The Church and the Reception Venue are about 15 minutes apart. 

<br>

see the maps below for locations of both the Ceremony and Reception.

<br>
<br>
If you’re looking to explore the city while in town, we recommend taking a ride share from the hotel and then using the street car in the French quarter. 

<br>

You can take the street car to most places in the city like uptown. Ride share is available as well. 

<br>

Please reach out if you need more suggestions!
